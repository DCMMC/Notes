@article{Chen_Sharma_Zhang_Yi_Hsieh_2018, title={EAD: Elastic-Net Attacks to Deep Neural Networks via Adversarial Examples}, volume={32}, url={https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/11302}, abstractNote={ &lt;p&gt; Recent studies have highlighted the vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to adversarial examples — a visually indistinguishable adversarial image can easily be crafted to cause a well-trained model to misclassify. Existing methods for crafting adversarial examples are based on &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; distortion metrics. However, despite the fact that &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; distortion accounts for the total variation and encourages sparsity in the perturbation, little has been developed for crafting &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-based adversarial examples. In this paper, we formulate the process of attacking DNNs via adversarial examples as an elastic-net regularized optimization problem. Our elastic-net attacks to DNNs (EAD) feature &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-oriented adversarial examples and include the state-of-the-art &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; attack as a special case. Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR10 and ImageNet show that EAD can yield a distinct set of adversarial examples with small &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1 &lt;/sub&gt;distortion and attains similar attack performance to the state-of-the-art methods in different attack scenarios. More importantly, EAD leads to improved attack transferability and complements adversarial training for DNNs, suggesting novel insights on leveraging &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; distortion in adversarial machine learning and security implications of DNNs. &lt;/p&gt; }, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Chen, Pin-Yu and Sharma, Yash and Zhang, Huan and Yi, Jinfeng and Hsieh, Cho-Jui}, year={2018}, month={Apr.} }

	abstract = {With the development of high computational devices, deep neural networks (DNNs), in recent years, have gained significant popularity in many Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. However, previous efforts have shown that DNNs are vulnerable to strategically modified samples, named adversarial examples. These samples are generated with some imperceptible perturbations, but can fool the DNNs to give false predictions. Inspired by the popularity of generating adversarial examples against DNNs in Computer Vision (CV), research efforts on attacking DNNs for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications have emerged in recent years. However, the intrinsic difference between image (CV) and text (NLP) renders challenges to directly apply attacking methods in CV to NLP. Various methods are proposed addressing this difference and attack a wide range of NLP applications. In this article, we present a systematic survey on these works. We collect all related academic works since the first appearance in 2017. We then select, summarize, discuss, and analyze 40 representative works in a comprehensive way. To make the article self-contained, we cover preliminary knowledge of NLP and discuss related seminal works in computer vision. We conclude our survey with a discussion on open issues to bridge the gap between the existing progress and more robust adversarial attacks on NLP DNNs.},

	abstract = {Website fingerprinting attacks have recently emerged as a serious threat against web browsing privacy mechanisms, such as SSL, Tor, and encrypting tunnels. Researchers have proposed numerous attacks and defenses, and the Tor project currently includes both network- and browser-level defenses against these attacks, but published defenses have high overhead, poor security, or both.In this paper we present preliminary results of {Glove}, a new SSH based defense. Glove is based on the observation that current defenses are expensive not because website traces are different, but because the defense, operating blindly, does not know how to add cover traffic and therefore, puts it everywhere. Instead, Glove uses existing knowledge of a websites traces to add cover traffic conservatively while maintaining high levels of security. Further, Glove satisfies the information theoretic definitions of security defined in prior work -- i.e., it is resistant to any fingerprinting adversary. Our simulations show that Glove performs better than all currently proposed SSH based defenses in terms of the security-overhead trade-off.},

	abstract="Website Fingerprinting attacks enable a passive eavesdropper to recover the user's otherwise anonymized web browsing activity by matching the observed traffic with prerecorded web traffic templates. The defenses that have been proposed to counter these attacks are impractical for deployment in real-world systems due to their high cost in terms of added delay and bandwidth overhead. Further, these defenses have been designed to counter attacks that, despite their high success rates, have been criticized for assuming unrealistic attack conditions in the evaluation setting. In this paper, we propose a novel, lightweight defense based on Adaptive Padding that provides a sufficient level of security against website fingerprinting, particularly in realistic evaluation conditions. In a closed-world setting, this defense reduces the accuracy of the state-of-the-art attack from 91 {\%} to 20 {\%}, while introducing zero latency overhead and less than 60 {\%} bandwidth overhead. In an open-world, the attack precision is just 1 {\%} and drops further as the number of sites grows.",

This gap results from the lack of an integrated framework which clarifies and synthesizes the multiple variables that explain how marketers make ethical/unethical decisions. A contingency framework is recommended as a starting point for the development of a theory of ethical/unethical actions in organizational environments. This model demonstrates how previous research can be integrated to reveal that ethical/unethical decisions are moderated by individual factors, significant others within the organizational setting, and opportunity for action. }

	abstract="Most research of class imbalance is focused on two class problem to date. A multi-class imbalance is so complicated that one has little knowledge and experience in Internet traffic classification. In this paper we study the challenges posed by Internet traffic classification using machine learning with multi-class unbalanced data and the ability of some adjusting methods, including resampling (random under-sampling, random over-sampling) and cost-sensitive learning. Then we empirically compare the effectiveness of these methods for Internet traffic classification and determine which produces better overall classifier and under what circumstances. Main works are as below. (1) Cost-sensitive learning is deduced with MetaCost that incorporates the misclassification costs into the learning algorithm for improving multi-class imbalance based on flow ratio. (2) A new resampling model is presented including under-sampling and over-sampling to make the multi-class training data more balanced. (3) The solution is presented to compare among three methods or to compare three methods with original case. Experiment results are shown on sixteen datasets that flow g-mean and byte g-mean are statistically increased by 8.6 {\%} and 3.7 {\%}; 4.4 {\%} and 2.8 {\%}; 11.1 {\%} and 8.2 {\%} when three methods are compared with original case. Cost-sensitive learning is as the first choice when the sample size is enough, but resampling is more practical in the rest.",
